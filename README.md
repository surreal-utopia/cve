## About This Repository

This repository serves as a collection of Python scripts developed for security research, learning, and performing **authorized** vulnerability assessments related to web applications. The goal is to provide practical examples and tools for understanding and identifying specific security weaknesses or vulnerability patterns.

New scripts addressing different vulnerabilities or testing techniques will be added periodically.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* **Python 3:** Scripts generally require Python 3 (e.g., 3.7+ recommended). Ensure Python 3 and `pip` are installed.
* **Git:** You'll need Git to clone the repository.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd <repository-name>
    ```
2.  **Check Script Dependencies:** Each script may have unique Python library dependencies. Refer to the specific documentation for the script you intend to use for installation instructions (often involving `pip install`).

## Available Scripts

This section lists the scripts currently available in the repository. Detailed usage instructions, specific requirements, and configuration options for each script can be found in their respective documentation files (typically a `README.md` within the script's directory).

* **`nextjs-middleware-bypass-tester/`**
    * *Description:* Checks for potential middleware bypasses in Next.js applications using the `x-middleware-subrequest` header pattern.
    * *Documentation:* **./nextjs-middleware-bypass-tester/README.md)** 

* *... More scripts will be added here as the repository grows ...*

## How to Use a Script (General Guide)

1.  Identify the script you need from the "Available Scripts" section above.
2.  Click the documentation link for that script to view its specific `README.md` file.
3.  Follow the installation and usage instructions provided in that specific documentation.
4.  Typically, you can get command-line help for a script by running `python <path_to_script.py> --help`.
